## Sparkle Release Automator

A simple macOS utility to automate the creation of Sparkle updates. It takes a `.app`, zips it, signs it using the EdDSA keys in your Keychain (via Sparkle's command line tools), and generates the required `appcast.xml`. You can add a custom URL to the `appcast.xml` as well.
